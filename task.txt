Given Two binary strings A and B, retrun their sum as a binary string

Example 1:
	input: A="11", B="1"
	output: "100"
Example 2:
	input: A="1010", B="1011"
	output: "10101"
Contraints:
	+ 1 <= A.length, B.length <= 104
	+ A and B consist only of '0' or '1' characters
	+ Each string does not contain leading zeros except for the zero itself
